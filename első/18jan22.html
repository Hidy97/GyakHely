<div class="focim">Lemaitre : Not too Late
Pretend to smile and wave goodbye everytime
I walk by the faces, people passing by
Sometimes I try to find out why I fell behind
Feels like I am blind but then some guy says it's

[Chorus]
Not too late my friend
To get up an try again
I'll stand right here
While you walk to face the end
As the skies clear up again
I'll disappear
And have it go again

[Verse 2]
Kinda cold, walking home
Growing older on my own
Feel so strange to say when I am not alone
Faith will claim to be a friend to those she own
But she will never try to call when I'm by the phone

[Chorus]
Not too late my friend
To get up an try again
I'll stand right here
While you walk to face the end
As skies clear up again
I'll disappear
And the sun will shine again
